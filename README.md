# Title: Automated Waste Segregation and Monitoring System Using IoT (waste Management)


## About

As the world's population continues to grow, so does the problem of improper waste management in metropolitan areas. This has resulted in the spread of disease and illness. To minimize the risks to both the public and the environment, it is essential that waste segregation, transport, handling, and disposal are managed effectively and efficiently. Our project, " automated waste segregation and monitoring system using IOT" is designed to do just that. As technology progresses, we are able to develop automated solutions to prevent garbage build-up. The waste segregator is designed to provide an easy way to dispose of collected waste. The system consists of two bins - one for wet waste and one for dry waste. As we drop waste into the bin, it detects the waste and classifies it using different sensors connected to the system. The waste is then deflected into the respective bin. The deflection procedure is carried out by servo motors which are programmed according to the working. This facilitates processing the different kinds of waste as per the requirement. The garbage level in each bin is monitored using the ultrasonic sensors present in every bin. The notification is then sent to the app thus notifying the concerned authorities for emptying the bin. The whole setup brings about automation by using NodeMCU ESP8266, Ultrasonic sensors, Servo motor, IR sensor, Soil sensor, Arduino IDE, and Blynk Application and hence reduces the human intervention required in segregating the waste and provides a successful collection of the garbage from the bin at the appropriate time. The system uses sensor data to display the status of garbage bin levels on a website and also sends a signal to mobile if a bin is full, allowing garbage to be collected.
